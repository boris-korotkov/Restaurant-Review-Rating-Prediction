# Restaurant Review Rating Prediction


   Another interesting project completed in Data Science Program was Restaurant Review Rating Prediction using [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/restaurant-reviews). In this project I built my foundation skills of Scala, Apache Spark MLlib, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). A free Databricks account was used to set up a Spark cluster.
